## My GitHub Pages site

I am interested in **data**
 
 - Reporting and visualising data
 - Analysing data to find useful insights
 -  Processes to promote data quality

I like the following data tools
  - R
  - SQL
  - GitHub

I also like some non data things like:

 - Science fiction
 - Sword and sorcery
 - History
